## Key Switches

![keyboard](/assets/img/uploads/kb_6.png)

Kailh Silver	40±10gf	1.1±0.3mm	Linear	This is an extremely smooth keyswitch. Light enough not to tire your fingers, and quiet, too. Ideal for soft typing in an office environment.  
Kailh Copper	40±10gf	1.1±0.3mm	Tactile	Quite similar to the Kailh Silver, only these are tactile. Think “Brown lite”.

## Conclusion

I ended up selecting the Kinesis Gaming keyboard and since broke the V key so now I'm back to the Apple Keyboard 😏
