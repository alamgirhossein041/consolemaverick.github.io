There are many gitflow models out there. This is one I've been using:

![gitflow](/assets/img/uploads/gitflow.png)

## Stage 1: project starts

• it is too cumbersome to merge request for every commit because you don’t have anything built yet  
• instead we start an unprotected branch called ‘develop’  
• since it’s unprotected anyone can push to it on gitlab  
• remember to follow the ‘Commit Message’ guidelines on every branch including this one  
	- FEATURE # Issue Number - Brief description  
  - BUG # Issue Number - Brief description  
  - REFACTOR # Issue Number - Brief description  
  - MISC # Issue Number - Brief description  

## Stage 2: you now have and MVP to show to the client so it’s time to create a staging server

• we introduce the ‘master’ branch which will be deployed to staging server  
• master branch is protected so to push code to it you have to issue a merge request which needs to be assigned to a senior developer on the project, if no senior developer exists assign it to m  
• at this point you should start using FEATURE and BUG branches  
• if you are working on a feature and find a problem with it, commit your fix on the feature branch, not directly to the develop branch, this keeps all the code together in a single branch that can be squashed to a single commit  
• master always contains working/shippable code, if the code is not working/shippable at this time you can keep it in develop branch but you have to remove it from master branch  
• merge bug fixes you discover on master branch back to develop branch  
• features are based off develop branch  
• merge features/bug fixes from develop branch to master branch  

## Stage 3: site is ready to go live so we create a production server

• now you have a staging and a production server  
• introduce a new branch called staging  
• mark staging branch as protected in gitlab  
• since it's protected you have to issue merge requests to push code to it  
• master branch now becomes production ready code  
• staging branch is what’s deployed to staging server  
• role of develop branch stays the same  
• staging branch may get push forced so don’t store your code there  
• if a feature needs to be disabled keep your code in develop branch  
• create hotfix brances off master branch if you need to fix something on production and merge them back into staging branch  
• merge back your hotfix into develop too  
• everything needs to come back to develop since it becomes the new staging at the beginning of every sprint and staging becomes the new master eventually  
• at the end of each sprint staging should be  
	○ tested  
	○ merged into master  
	○ deployed to production server  
	○ tagged with a gitlab sprint #  
• when a new sprint begins push force develop to staging branch  

## Merge requests

• if you get a merge request assigned to you examine the code, see if it makes sense, if it doesn’t then make a comment on gitlab and reject it  
• verify the build is passing before approving merge requests, if it’s failing, get it fixed first, do not approve merge requests that fail to bulid  
	○ rspec must pass  
	○ frontend spec must pass  
	○ rubocop must pass  
• if it’s failing create an issue for the developer to fix the build  
• if it makes sense and the build passes, approve the merge request and mark the remote branch for deletion after merge request is complete  

## See it in action

### Stage 1

1. create test repository on gitlab
2. create develop branch and allow anyone to push to it

```
git clone gitlab@gitlab.company.com:company/test.git
cd test
git checkout -b develop
echo 'readme' >]]> README.md
git add .
git commit
# initial commit
git push -u origin develop
```

1. create gitlab project
2. create sprint 1
3. create feature
4. confirm you are in develop branch

```
echo 'some code' >]]> feature.rb
git add .
git commit
# FEATURE #23423 - User registration
git push
```

1. you discover a bug
2. create issue on gitlab
3. confirm you are in develop branch

```
echo 'some code' >]]> fix.rb
git add .
git commit
# BUG #234234 - Fix user registration
git push
```

### Stage 2

assume staging server is already created and we can just issue ‘cap staging deploy’

1. create master branch and protect it
2. set master branch as default

```
git checkout master
# work on feature
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/4324_forgot_password
echo 'some code' >]]> feature2.rb
git add .
git commit
# FEATURE #4324 - Add 'Forgot password'
git push -u origin feature/4324_forgot_password
# do another commit
echo 'some code' >]]> feature3.rb
git add .
git commit
# FEATURE #4324 - Add 'Forgot password' feature
#
# - change spelling
git push
```

1. since this feature is complete, ready to create merge request to put it on staging so it can de delpoyed
2. create merge request
3. go through accepting merge request
4. examine code

```
cap staging deploy
```

1. what if you find a bug on staging?
2. create issue on gitlab

```
git checkout master
git pull #other people may have pushed
git checkout -b bug/4355_fix_forgot_password
echo 'some code' >]]> bug.rb
git add .
git commit
# BUG #4355 - fix forgot password
git push -u origin bug/4355_fix_forgot_password
```

1. create merge request
2. once it's merged to master, deploy it

```
cap staging deploy
```

and merge it back into develop branch

```
git checkout develop
git merge master
```

### Stage 3

• assume we have a production server setup and we can issue ‘cap production deploy’  
• create staging branch on gitlab and mark it as protected  

```
git checkout develop
git checkout -b staging
git push -u origin staging
```

• now staging branch is deployed to staging and master branch is deployed to production  
• everything is same as before but now you also have hotfix branches for when you discover a problem on production  
• create issue on gitlab  

```
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout -b hotfix/5454_fix_email
echo 'some code' >]]> fix2.rb
git add .
git commit
# BUG #5454 - Fix email
git push -u origin hotfix/5454_fix_email
```

1. create merge request
2. once merged

```
cap production deploy
```

marge it back to staging

```
git checkout staging
git merge master
```

merge it back to deploy

```
git checkout deploy
git merge master
```

when sprint ends

```
git checkout staging
git pull
```

make sure it's tested, spec passes, rubocop passes, have senior dev do the merge

```
git checkout master
git merge staging
git tag 1.0 #sprint number
cap production deploy
```

once new sprint begins restart staging branch from develop

```
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout staging
git reset --hard develop
git push origin staging --force
```
