I don't about you but I only became a console cowboy cause of Keanu Reeves.

I've hand picked these. I'm sure you will find something to your liking here. If it's not fast and pretty I don't use it.

## lnav

![lnav](/assets/img/uploads/lnav.png)

It's like tail but can handle multiple files on the same interface and jumping between errors.

## sssh

Do you find yourself waiting for a machine to come up after you rebooted it? Does the machine not respond to ping? Why keep trying to SSH into the box when you can be checking your crypto portfolio instead.

Save this script as sssh and make it executable. It will continue attempting to connect to a server via ssh until it gets in. 

```
#!/bin/bash

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo '' && echo 'Please also provide server name as in config file...' &&
  exit 1
fi

retries=0
repeat=true
today=$(date)

while "$repeat"; do
  ((retries+=1)) &&
  echo "Try number $retries..." &&
  today=$(date) &&
  ssh "$@" &&
  repeat=false
  if "$repeat"; then
    sleep 5
  fi
done

echo "Total number of tries: $retries"
echo "Last connection at: $today"
```

```
sssh 99.99.99.99
```

## icanhazip

![icanhazip](/assets/img/uploads/icanhazip.png)

Get the IP of the server you're on via curl.

## fd

![fd](/assets/img/uploads/fd.png)

It's like find except it's not shit. It's fast too.

## ncdu

![ncdu](/assets/img/uploads/ncdu.png)

Is the client calling you cause the machine is hung cause there's no HD space left? Find out what's eating up all the space.

## htop

![htop](/assets/img/uploads/htop.png)

It's like top except it doesn't hurt the artist in you looking at it.

[bat](https://hisham.hm/htop/)

## bat

![bat](/assets/img/uploads/bat.png)

It's an esthetically pleasing `cat`

## fzf

![fzf](/assets/img/uploads/fzf.png)

fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder. You can integrate it into your vim and shell. Use it to fuzzy find anything.

## tig

![tig](/assets/img/uploads/tig.png)

Git repo browser. Merge, commit, browse. Very useful for figuring out who broke the build on production.

## tree

![tree](/assets/img/uploads/tree.jpg)

Recursively `ls` the subdirectories

`sudo apt-get install tree`

## pgcli

PostgreSQL CLI with autocomplete. Aware of columns, tables and PostgreSQL commands.
