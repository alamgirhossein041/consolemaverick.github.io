Highlights from [The 10X Rule](https://amzn.to/3b6jpbi) by Grant Cardone

* biggest mistake I've made is failing to set my targets high enough—in both personal and professional aspects of my life.  
* it takes the same amount of energy and effort to make $10 million as it does $10,000.  
* Setting the right targets, estimating the mandatory effort, and operating at the right level of action(s) are the only things that will guarantee success—and  
* in order to get to the next level of whatever you're doing, you must think and act in a wildly different way than you previously have been.  
* Your thoughts and actions are the reasons why you are where you are right now.  
* While it might not be “exceptional” compared with what others are seeking, the goal you set should always move you to a better place—or toward an objective you've not yet achieved.  
* An interesting thing about success is that it's like a breath of air; although your last breath of air is important, it's not nearly as important as the next one.  
* If you stop trying to succeed, it's like trying to live the rest of your life off the last breath of air.  
* Limiting the amount of success you desire is a violation of the 10X Rule  
* When people start limiting the amount of success they desire, I assure you they will limit what will be required of them in order to achieve success  
* You must set targets that are 10 times what you think you want and then do 10 times what you think it will take to accomplish those targets.  
* 10X Rule is about pure domination mentality. You never do what others do. You must be willing to do what they won't do—and even take actions that you might deem “unreasonable.”  
* 10X people never approach a target aiming to achieve just that goal. Instead, they're looking to dominate the entire sector  
* If you start any task with a mind toward limiting the potential outcome, you will limit the actions necessary to accomplish that very goal.  
* Mistargeting by setting objectives that are too low and don't allow for enough correct motivation.  
* herd mentality—one based on competition instead of domination  
* They thought in terms of “I have to do what my colleague/neighbor/family member is doing” instead of “I have to do what's best for me.”  
* Many people, in fact, have been programmed to set targets that are not even of their own design.  
* We are told what is considered to be “a lot of money”—what is rich, poor, or middle class. We have predetermined notions about what is fair, what is difficult, what is possible, what is ethical, what is good, what is bad, what is ugly, what tastes good, what looks good, and on and on.  
* Chances are that you have more often been disappointed by setting targets that are too low and achieving them—only to be shocked that you still didn't get what you wanted.  
* you'll suffer greatly by setting subpar targets. You simply will not invest the energy, effort, and resources necessary to accommodate unexpected variables and conditions that are certain to occur sometime during the course of the project or event.  
* Why spend your life making only enough money to end up with not enough money?  
* Why get merely “good” at something when you know the marketplace only rewards excellence?  
* I was getting four times the results by making 10 times the effort.  
* when you correctly estimate the effort necessary, you will assume the appropriate posture.  
* marketplace will sense by your actions that you are a force to be reckoned with and are not going away—and it will begin to respond accordingly.  
* Never reduce a target. Instead, increase actions.  
* When you start rethinking your targets, making up excuses, and letting yourself off the hook, you are giving up on your dreams!  
* target is never the problem. Any target attacked with the right actions in the right amounts with persistence is attainable.  
* there will be something you will never foresee, regardless of how detailed your business plan is.  
* I don't care if your product cost nothing to make and it's 100 times superior to its closest competitor; you will still have to apply 10 times more effort just to push through all the noise in order to get people to even know about it.  
* Anyone who minimizes the importance of success to your future has given up on his or her own chances of accomplishment and is spending his or her life trying to convince others to do the same.  
* children who can't get what they want will fight for a little while, cry for a bit, and then convince themselves that they never wanted it in the first place.  
* People create magical momentum by reaching their goals, which compels them to set—and eventually reach—even loftier goals.  
* If you are able to repeatedly attain success, it becomes less of a “success” and more of a habit—almost everyday life for some people.  
* successful individuals approach success as a duty, obligation, and responsibility—and even a right!  
* say that there's an opportunity for success in the vicinity of two people. Do you think it will end up with the person who believes success is his or her duty—who reaches out and grabs it—or the one who approaches it with a “take-it-or-leave-it” attitude?  
* there is no “limit” as to how much success can be created. You can have as much as you want,  
* most people look at success as though it is somehow a scarcity.  
* think that if someone else is successful, it will somehow inhibit their ability to create success.  
* It's extremely difficult for people to “agree to disagree”; people operate under the assumption that one person's beliefs cannot be maintained if another person's conflicting beliefs exist.  
* individual worth $400 million should be an encouragement to you that anything is possible.  
* most—if not all—shortages are simply manufactured notions.  
* You must rid yourself of the concept that success can be restricted in any way.  
* others' achievements actually create an opportunity for you to win as well.  
* moment you start thinking someone else's gain is your loss, you limit yourself by thinking in terms of competition and shortages.  
* crybabies, whiners, and victims just don't do well at attracting or creating success.  
* people who typically succeed are required to take big actions—and it is impossible to take big actions if you don't take responsibility.  
* whatever is going on in your world—good, bad, or nothing—is something caused by you.  
* I assume control over everything that happens to me, even for those things that I appear to have no control over.  
* If, for example, the electricity goes out in my neighborhood, rather than blaming the city or the state for blackouts, I look at what I could do differently in order not to be impacted negatively the next time this happens.  
* Assume control and increase responsibility by adopting the position that you make all things happen,  
* Never take the position that things just happen to you;  
* they happen because of something you did or did not do.  
* Blaming someone or something else only extends how long you will be a victim and slave.  
* you draw or attract into your life the things—and people—to which you pay the most attention.  
* possibility, then, that you made some decision that you might not have even be aware of sometime prior to your appointment to, in a sense, create this supposed accident so that you could continue to have something to blame for your life?  
* Anytime you play victim in order to “be right,” you are taking on the identity of a victim, and that can't be a good thing.  
* Until a person is done being a victim, he or she is unable to create solutions and success. That person only has problems.  
* Once you start to approach every situation as someone who is acting—not being acted upon—you will start to have more control over your life.  
* You are the source, the generator, the origin, and the reason for everything—both positive and negative.  
* most people on the planet spend their time in the first through third degrees: doing nothing, retreating completely, or just operating at normal levels of activity.  
* Only the most successful people hit on very high levels of action that I refer to as massive.  
* do not assume that doing nothing requires no energy, effort, and work!  
* it is not normal human behavior to retreat but rather to advance and conquer.  
* during childhood, “don't touch that,” “be careful,” “don't talk to him,” “get away from that,” and so on and then start to adopt retreat as an action.  
* We tend to be pulled away from the very things about which we're most curious.  
* We might even be encouraged to retreat by a work associate, friend, or family member who believes we are “too ambitious” or focused on a single area of our lives.  
* They will then spend as much energy justifying their decision to retreat as the most successful person will in creating success.  
* This level of action creates the middle class and is actually the most dangerous—because it's considered acceptable.  
* taking enough action to appear average and create normal lives,  
* Taking normal action is the most dangerous of the levels, because it is the most accepted by society.  
* Since it was already hard work not succeeding, I just changed the focus.  
* You will know you are stepping into the realm of massive action when you (1) create new problems for yourself and (2) start to receive criticism and warning from others.  
* Average doesn't work in any area of life. Anything that you give only average amounts of attention to will start to subside and will eventually cease to exist.  
* Rid yourself of everything that is average including the advice you get and friends you keep.  
* since there is no shortage of success, any apparent limitations you are experiencing might simply be the result of thinking and acting average.  
* prohibit yourself and your team from considering average as an option.  
* Surround yourself with exceptional thinkers and doers.  
* Let your friends, family, and work associates know that you treat average like a terminal disease.  
* average anything will never get you to an extraordinary life.  
* if you start small, you are probably going to go small.  
* who gets excited about so-called realistic goals?  
* you have to make your goals substantial enough that they keep your attention.  
* Average and realistic goals are almost always a letdown to the person setting them  
* most people are so apathetic about their goals that they only write them down once a year.  
* nothing worth doing is done only once or twice a year.  
* write my goals down every day  
* choose objectives that are just out of reach.  
* word your goals as though you've already accomplished them.  
* keep a legal pad next to my bed so that I can record my goals first thing each morning and right before I go to bed at night.  
* bigger and more unrealistic your goals are—and the more they're aligned to your purpose and duty—the more they'll energize and fuel your actions.  
* bigger and juicier it is, the more likely you will be motivated to move in that direction and through resistance.  
* When you are setting a goal, be sure you are clear about what you want it for,  
* I hated it—and not because it was McDonald's. I hated it because it was not lined up with my goals and purposes. The guy who worked next to me loved his job because it aligned with his goals and purposes.  
* I was the guy making $7 an hour because I wanted some spending money, and he was the guy making $7 an hour but who wanted to learn the business and open 100 franchises.  
* Ask yourself whether the goals you have set are equal to your potential.  
* Many people find themselves on the path they're on simply because they're doing what other—average—people have done.  
* be willing to rewrite them every day until they are achieved.  
* competing with others limits a person's ability to think creatively because he or she is constantly watching what someone else is doing  
* Forward thinkers don't copy. They don't compete—they create.  
* They also don't look at what others have done.  
* Don't let another company set the pace;  
* Don't set your goals at a competitive level. Set them at a level that will overshadow and dominate your sector completely.  
* best way to dominate is to do what others refuse to do.  
* Though I am always ethical, I never play fair.  
* seek out ways in which I can get an unfair advantage  
* Find something they cannot do, maybe because of their size or their commitment to other projects, and then exploit that.  
* Never play by the agreed-upon norms within which others operate.  
* it is important to be considered first in the space  
* The message you want to send to the marketplace through your persistent actions is, “No one can keep up with me. I'm not going away. I am not a competitor. I am the space.”  
* Like every other aspect of growing your business, you have to keep showing up over and over and make it obvious that you are not going away.  
* You can't dominate if you don't penetrate, and you won't penetrate by using reasonable levels of activity.  
* take your actions to a point considered unreasonable by the world,  
* dominate your sector with actions, that are immediate, consistent, and persistent and at levels that no one else is willing to operate at or duplicate.  
* Learn how to dominate by being first in the minds of your market,  
* Even if you are in a weak market, you suffer less when you dominate it.  
* Weak markets actually create opportunities because the players in those markets typically have become dependent and weak because they don't know how to operate in a more challenging environment. Don't feel sorry for them; dominate them.  
* marketplace is brutal and will punish anyone and everyone who does not take the right amounts of action.  
* Quit thinking about competing. Despite what everyone says, it's not healthy. It's for sissies.  
* I know many of you have spent your whole life trying to get to the middle class, and I am about to tell you it is the wrong goal.  
* Before you make a decision about where you are going or the group you're striving to belong to, it would be wise to inspect the statistics of that group.  
* middle class is the most suppressed, restricted, and confined socioeconomic demographic in the world.  
* Those who desire to be a part of it are compelled to think and act in a certain way where “just enough” is the reward.  
* The idea that one would only have enough to be “comfortable” or “adequately satisfied” is a concept that has been sold—by the educational system, the media, and politicians—to convince an entire population of people to settle instead of strive for abundance.  
* dictionary defines the term “obsessed” as “the domination of one's thoughts or feelings by a persistent idea, image, or desire.” Although the rest of the world tends to treat this mind-set like a disease, I believe that it's the perfect adjective for how you must approach success.  
* you want to be so fanatical about success that the world knows you will not compromise or go away.  
* Most people make only enough effort for it to feel like work, whereas the most successful follow up every action with an obsession to see it through to a reward.  
* if your ideas do not excessively preoccupy your own thoughts, then how can you ever expect them to preoccupy the thoughts of others? Something has to absorb your thoughts every second of every day—so what should it be?  
* Make your dreams, goals, and mission your mind's and actions' dominant concern!  
* show me one person who has achieved greatness without being obsessed on some level.  
* complete preoccupation of whatever they desire—be it a pacifier, a toy, food, daddy's attention, or an urgent need to be changed. In this way, we see how obsession is a natural human state. It doesn't become a “problem” until a parent, caretaker, teacher—and eventually, society as a whole—begins suppressing this fixation.  
* At this point, many children begin to assume that their intense interest in life and discovery—their innate commitment to be fully engaged—is somehow wrong or unnatural.  
* heart—who is so consumed by their ideas that they wake up to their dreams each day, work on them all day long, and then go to sleep and dream about them again all night?  
* become obsessed about the things you want; otherwise, you are going to spend a lifetime being obsessed with making up excuses as to why you didn't get the life you wanted. It is unfortunate  
* once the obsessed finally do become successful, they're no longer labeled as crazy but instead as geniuses,  
* never dilute greatness, never pull back on your horsepower, and never put a limit on your ambition, drive, and passion.  
* Demand obsession of yourself and all those around you. Never make it wrong to be obsessed; instead, make it your goal.  
* Most of society discourages the all-in mentality because we are taught to play it safe and not to put everything at risk.  
* giants on this planet are willing to make the big plays.  
* feared failure or rejection and never even played a hand—much less went all in.  
* What's the worst thing that can happen to you if you just totally go for it? You may lose the customer, but so what? You still have unlimited resources to give it your all with the next client.  
* Why not overcommit in your promise—and then exceed by overdelivering as well?  
* I find that the greater the commitment I make to a client, the higher my level of delivery naturally becomes.  
* you need new problems. They're signs that you're making progress and heading in the right direction.  
* Learn to commit first, and figure out how to show up later.  
* Most people simply never bother to perform and instead spend their time trying to wrap their heads around things that may never happen for them.  
* Anyone who doesn't face new problems but who instead grapples with the same old problems his or her whole life isn't moving forward.  
* If you are not creating new problems for yourself, then you aren't taking enough action.  
* Wouldn't it be nice if you had too many people to see at 2  
* major differences between successful and unsuccessful people is that the former look for problems to resolve, whereas the latter make every attempt to avoid them.  
* Double book take a risk and solve any fallout later  
* there are, of course, times when you must defend, retreat, and conserve, you should only do so for short periods of time—in order to prepare yourself to reinforce and attack  
* never want to blindly follow the masses; they are almost always wrong. Instead of following the pack, lead them!  
* The way out is to expand, push, and take action—regardless of what others are saying and doing.  
* Once you take 10X actions and start getting traction, you must continue to add wood to your fire until you either start a brushfire or a bonfire—or burn the place down. Don't rest, and don't stop—ever.  
* Keep stacking wood until the fire is so hot and burns so brightly that not even competitors or market changes can put your fire out.  
* until you can't stop your forward momentum. You might even find yourself operating on less sleep and food because you are literally subsisting on your adrenaline generated by your victories.  
* Be particularly wary of those who suggest you have “done enough” or who advise you to take a rest or vacation.  
* Now is not the time for rest and celebration; it's time for more action.  
* best way to quit worrying about competition and uncertainty is to build a fire so large and so hot that everyone in the world—even your competition—comes to sit by your fire for warmth.  
* Don't worry about the resistance you're afraid you'll face from either the market or your competitors. They'll get right out of your way once they see that you're a force to be reckoned with.  
* you will experience fear when you start taking new actions at new levels. In fact, if you aren't, then you're probably not doing enough of the right things.  
* Fear isn't bad or something to avoid; conversely, it's something you want to seek and embrace.  
* Fear is actually a sign that you are doing what's needed to move in the right direction. An absence of concerns signals that you are only doing what's comfortable  
* that will only get you more of what you have right now.  
* you want to be scared until you have to push yourself to new levels to experience fear again.  
* FEAR stands for False Events Appearing Real  
* rather than seeing fear as a sign to run—as most other people in the market will do—it must become your indicator to go.  
* Last-minute preparation is just another way to feed the fear that will only get stronger as time is added.  
* when you experience fear, it's a sign that the best time to take action is at that very moment.  
* fear is a sign to do whatever it is you fear—and do it quickly.  
* I am scared most of the time. However, I refuse to feed my fear with time and allow it to get stronger. I opt instead to get things done quickly.  
* You will experience the same when you're finally able to take the plunge and do what you fear. In fact, you'll be amazed at how much stronger you become and how much more confident you are to do new things.  
* If you aren't experiencing fear, you are not taking new actions and growing.  
* If you don't know how much time you have—or need—then how on earth can you expect to manage and balance it?  
* I personally am not interested in balance; I am interested in abundance in every area.  
* unsuccessful people tend to place limits on themselves. They may believe that “If I am rich, I can't be happy”  
* people who put limits on what is available to them are also most inclined to talk about “balance.”  
* pointless for people to worry about time management and balance. The question they should be asking is “How can I have it all in abundance?”  
* Quit thinking in terms of either/or and start thinking in terms of all and everything.  
* keep track of how you're spending your available time, perhaps in a journal. Most people have no clue what they are doing with their time but still complain that they don't have enough.  
* part—if you are 37 years old, then you have only 1,950 Wednesdays left. What if you had only $1,950 left to your name? Would you watch it slip away, or would you do whatever you could to increase it?  
* If I get 15 phone calls done in 15 minutes and you get 15 calls done in one hour, then I have essentially created 45 minutes for myself.  
* first take control of your time—not allow others to do so.  
* Log how you are spending your time daily  
* This will allow you to see all the ways in which you waste your time  
* Any action that is not adding wood to your fire would be considered wasteful  
* agree upon which priorities are most important. If you don't do this, you will have people with different agendas pulling you in all sorts of directions.  
* Work should provide a purpose, a mission, and a sense of accomplishment. These things are vital to every single person's mental, emotional, and physical well-being.  
* comes as a natural result of getting attention. This may be why some people avoid attention in the first place—as an attempt to dodge judgment.  
* No matter what choices you make in life, someone is going to criticize you somewhere along the way.  
* I won't apologize for any employee of mine who is seeking success.  
* criticism precedes admiration and—like it or not—goes hand in hand with success.  
* trend of focusing on customer satisfaction has been detrimental to customer acquisition.  
* The more people you serve, the better your chances are of interacting with quality customers.  
* even if your product and company deliver perfectly, you are going to get complaints from customers  
* can't keep everyone happy all the time.  
* It's a mistake to be scared of complaints. Instead, encourage them, look for them, find them, and then resolve them. Complaints are your customers' very direct way of telling you exactly how to make your product  
* can't keep everyone happy all the time.  
* You want people to see you so often that they think of you constantly and instantaneously identify your face or name or logo with not just the offering you represent but even the offering made by those similar to you.  
* “Your name is your most important asset.  
* your excuse for being late to work is due to traffic. Well, that's not truly the reason you didn't make it to work on time. The reason you were late is because you left your home without enough time to allow for traffic.  
* Excuses are never the reason for why you did or didn't do something. They're just a revision of the facts that you make up in order to help yourself feel better about what happened (or didn't).  
* Excuses are for people who refuse to take responsibility for their life and how it turns out. Slaves and victims make excuses—and will forever be destined to having leftovers and others' scraps.  
* will any of these excuses ever improve your condition? I doubt it. So why, then, do so many people make them so often?  
* An excuse is just an alteration of reality; nothing about it will move you to a better situation.  
* differences between making excuses and providing actual, sound reasons for events.  
* “Nothing happens to you; it happens because of you.”  
* “He didn't buy from me because the bank wouldn't make the loan.” No, he didn't buy from you because you were unable to secure proper financing for a potential customer. The first statement assumes no responsibility for the event, while the other does—and identifies a solution.  
* Once you adopt a more advanced sense of responsibility—and refuse to make any more excuses—then you can go out and search for a solution.  
* quality of being rare is what makes something valuable.  
* anything that is plentiful has very little worth.  
* must commit to never using excuses for anything!  
* Success is no different than any other skill. Duplicate the actions and mind-sets of successful people, and you will create success for yourself.  
* People with a “can do” attitude approach every situation with the outlook that no matter what, it can be done.  
* always maintain that a solution exists.  
* Even if you're not sure how to do something, the best answer is “I will figure it out”—not “I don't know.”  
* No one values a person who not only doesn't have the information but doesn't want to know the information.  
* Success is overcoming a challenge. Therefore, you can't succeed without some kind of difficulty.  
* get to a place where every challenge becomes fuel for you.  
* Give me a problem—any problem—and when I solve it, I will be rewarded and I may become a hero.  
* bigger the problems—and the more people who benefit from the solution—the more powerful your success will be.  
* someone who makes situations better, not worse.  
* ability to persist on a given path regardless of setbacks, unexpected events, bad news, and resistance—to continue steadfastly or firmly in some state, purpose, or course of action in spite of conditions—is a trait common to those who make  
* any endeavor I tackle will require me to persist with 10X actions until all resistance morphs into support.  
* I don't try to eliminate resistance; I merely keep going until the course changes and my ideas are maintained instead of defied.  
* taught to play it safe, be conservative, and never really “go for it” in a big way.  
* At some point, you will have to take a risk, and the successful are willing to do so daily.  
* Being unreasonable requires that you act without rational consideration and not in accordance with practical realities  
* They know they cannot afford to act in accordance with the agreed-upon realities.  
* If they do, the supposed “impossible” can never become possible for them. Being a 10X-er requires thinking and acting unreasonably.  
* Otherwise, you will end up the same way everyone else does—forced to survive on successful people's leftovers.  
* Being careful requires you to take actions cautiously—and there is no way that you will ever hit 10X activity levels by being cautious.  
* To do something big, you have to embrace danger.  
* People who invest in their own companies do so in order to increase their wealth, not their incomes. The unsuccessful, on the other hand, spend money on things that affluent individuals use to create wealth. Income is taxed; wealth is not.  
* You don't need to “make” money. It has already been made. There are no shortages of actual money—only shortages of people creating wealth.  
* Move your attention from conserving money to creating wealth  
* Readily Take Action  
* The highly successful take unbelievable amounts of action.  
* You know that you have an automatic “no” in you all ready to go—one that is backed with a 100 reasons why you can't, shouldn't, or don't have time to do something.  
* Unsuccessful people rarely commit to anything entirely. They are always talking about “trying,”  
* if you called a client 50 times and didn't get the deal done, then you might as well have not called that person at all.  
* There exist only two times for the successful: now and the future. The unsuccessful spend most of their time in the past  
* “Now” is the period of time that successful people utilize most often to create the futures they desire  
* acquire the discipline, muscle memory, and achievements that result from taking massive action—while others think, plan, and procrastinate.  
* 10X Rule requires that you take action in massive quantities and immediately.  
* Anyone who puts off doing what he or she can do right now will never gain the momentum and confidence that result from doing so.  
* You will be amazed how much you can get done when you quit thinking, calculating, and procrastinating and just get on with it and make a habit of acting now.  
* While others are trying to figure out how they will get something done, you will have already finished it.  
* successful people carry themselves with an air of confidence and conviction, a sense of comfort, and maybe even a touch of arrogance. Before you start thinking that they are somehow inherently “different,” you should understand that they acquired these qualities as a result of taking action.  
* The more frequently you can do things that scare you a bit, the more others will label you as courageous—and then gravitate toward you.  
* Do things that scare you more frequently, and they will slowly begin to scare you a bit less—until they become so habitual that you wonder why you ever feared them in the first place!  
* successful know that they can quantify what works and what doesn't work, whereas the unsuccessful focus solely on “hard work.”  
* unsuccessful always find work to be difficult because they never take enough time to improve their approach and make it easier on themselves.  
* pay more attention to the target than the problem.  
* many folks spend more time planning what they will get at the grocery store than they do setting the most important goals of their lives.  
* If you don't stay focused on your goals, you will spend your life achieving the objectives of other people  
* Quit patting yourself on the back for trying, and save your rewards and accolades for actual accomplishment.  
* never let yourself off the hook until you get results.  
* Results (not efforts)—regardless of the challenges, resistance, and problems—are a primary focus of the successful.  
* Successful people dream big and have immense goals. They are not realistic. They leave that to the masses, who fight for leftovers.  
* middle class are taught to be realistic, whereas the successful think in terms of how extensively they can spread themselves.  
* don't deal in other people's realities. Instead, they are bent on creating a new reality for themselves that is different from the one that others accept.  
* aren't interested in what other people deem possible or impossible; they only care about producing the things they dream are possible.  
* high disregard—even dislike—for mass agreement.  
* created a reality that did not exist before they came along.  
* Commit First—Figure Out Later  
* You can only be as successful as the individuals with whom you involve and associate yourself.  
* group—your success is limited to the ability of those around you.  
* most successful CEOs are reported to read an average of 60 books and attend more than six conferences per year—whereas
